Challenges Faced:

1.The embedding model was working slow
Error identified: Model was loading multiple times affecting the speed to create vectors
Solution:Model loaded only once

2.Improper chunking led to wrong query scores and results
Error identified:Fixed size chunking does not store proper context
Solution: Switched to Recursive chunking that stores proper context

3.Metadata filtering and retrieving
Error identified:Improper filters generated and SelfQueryRetriever documentation not found properly
Solution: Used llm to extract the metadata and Qdrant query to filter and retrieve the results

4.Improper result from llm
Error identified: Prompt template rules not setup properly
Solution: Prompt template instructions added properly
